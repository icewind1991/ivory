# ivory-sys

Bindings to php.

## PHP version

While building, it will grab the source for the php version specified in `Cargo.toml`.
Thus changing the version number of the crate also changes the version of php which it's compiled against

## Credits

This crate is taken almost entirely from [php-sys](https://github.com/hjr3/php-rpm/tree/master/php-sys), all credit goes to it's authors
